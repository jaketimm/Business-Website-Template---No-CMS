This is a guide to adding a blog with built in CMS to a website. 

Steps: 

1. Copy in the admin folder as is. This sets the CMS system behavior and imports Decap's scipts.
2. Copy in the .github folder as is. This creates a github workflow that updates 'blogFiles.json'
when a post is added or removed.
3. Copy in the blog folder. The .md posts and images can be removed. Do not delete the 'blogFiles.json'
file as it is needed. Leave the images/ folder as this is where uploaded images are stored.
4. Copy the extra blog logic into the index page (scripts at the top and bottom)
5. Copy in the blog_posts_preview_page.html as is. This page loads and renders preview cards for all posts.
6. Copy in the post.html page as is. This is a generic page for showing any blog post.
7. Copy in the package.json file as is.
8. Copy in the generate_blog_files.js script as is. This updates 'blogFiles.json' with the current list
of all markdown blog files. It runs automatically using the github workflow.
